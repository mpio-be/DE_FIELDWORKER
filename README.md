The interface in `\main` is both :  
* a landing page that links to the [DataEntry](https://github.com/mpio-be/DataEntry), [gpxui](https://github.com/mpio-be/gpxui) interfaces and some other web apps.     
* a mapping, viewing and reporting interface.

The interfaces outside of `\main` are self-contained and can be run independently if needed.
